Hi there!

I’m currently learning JavaScript and planning to explore React as the next step in my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. I’m passionate about improving UI/UX designs and creating intuitive, pixel-perfect layouts.

You can reach me on GitHub or Twitter at @ITx-prash.

Fun fact: I’m a Marvel fan and an average anime enthusiast.
